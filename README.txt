## Overview
This README file provides information about the supplementary materials that accompany the paper titled "Using logistic regression and the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test to analyze categorical data in biological experiments". The supplement includes three example datasets included in R project files. Each project runs two programs: "Reformatting Input" and "Logistic Regression". The input folders contain raw data and the expanded dataset (generated by the reformatting code). Also incldued in this supplement, annotated PDFs of the code and analysis of the statistical output.

## Contents
The supplementary materials consist of the following files and directories:

Supplemental Materials/: Directory containing all datasets used in the analysis.

Logistic_Regression_Aging/: Directory containing the datasets, code, and annotated PDFs for a single comparison between two variables. In this case the data is comparing exopher frequency on adult day two (AD2) and adult day five (AD5)
		
input/: Directory containing excel spreadsheets of raw data and output from the reformatting_data program
Logistic_Regression_Aging.Rproj: R project for the reformatting and analysis of this data. Open this directly in R Studio to run the Formatting and Logistic Regression programs
Formatting_Input_Aging.R: Source code to expand a dataset from total observations into individual observations
Logistic_Regression_Aging.R: Source code to calculate percentages, standard error of the percentage, plot the data, run Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test, run a logistic regression, and calculate odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals
Formatting_Input_Aging_Code_Annotated.pdf: Annotated PDF of the formating code with additional comments and highlighting terms that might need to be altered to adapt the code to another dataset
Logistic_Regression_Aging_Code_Annotated.pdf: Annotated PDF of the logistic regression code with additional comments and highlighting terms that might need to be altered to adapt the code to another dataset
Logistic_Regression_Aging_Output_Annotated.pdf: Annotated PDF of the output from the logistic regression code with more explaination of the statistical analysis and intepretation of the results

Logistic_Regression_Fertility/:Directory containing the datasets, code, and annotated PDFs for making a comparison between a control and multiple variables. In this case the data is comparing exopher frequency in an "Unmated" worm (Control), a worm mated with a "Sterile Male", and a worm mated with a "Fertile Male" 
		
input/: Directory containing excel spreadsheets of raw data and output from the reformatting_data program
Logistic_Regression_Fertility.Rproj: R project for the reformatting and analysis of this data. Open this directly in R Studio to run the Formatting and Logistic Regression programs
Formatting_Input_Fertility.R: Source code to expand a dataset from total observations into individual observations
Logistic_Regression_Fertility.R: Source code to calculate percentages, standard error of the percentage, plot the data, run a logistic regression, and calculate odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals
Formatting_Input_Fertility_Code_Annotated.pdf: Annotated PDF of the formating code with additional comments and highlighting terms that might need to be altered to adapt the code to another dataset
Logistic_Regression_Fertility_Code_Annotated.pdf: Annotated PDF of the logistic regression code with additional comments and highlighting terms that might need to be altered to adapt the code to another dataset
Logistic_Regression_Fertility_Output_Annotated.pdf: Annotated PDF of the output from the logistic regression code with more explaination of the statistical analysis and intepretation of the results

Logistic_Regression_Anoxia/: Directory containing the datasets, code, and annotated PDFs for making a comparison between a control and multiple variables measured repeatedly acrosss multiple timepoints.
